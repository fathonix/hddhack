THIS TOOL CAN KILL YOUR HARD DISK! No warrantee of any kind is implied. If
you lose data or hardware, it's your own fault!

This tool is only tested for HDs with 256KByte of flash. You probably will
need to fiddle with some defines etc to get it to work on other hard disks.

It will also only work with WD hard disks and fail on other brands.
